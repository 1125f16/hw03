Introduction to Computational Biology and Bioinformatics. </strong><em>9 units (3-0-6); second term. Prerequisites: Bi 8, CS 2, Ma 3; or BE/Bi 103; or instructors permission. </em>Biology is becoming an increasingly data-intensive science. Many of the data challenges in the biological sciences are distinct from other scientific disciplines because of the complexity involved. This course will introduce key computational, probabilistic, and statistical methods that are common in computational biology and bioinformatics. We will integrate these theoretical aspects to discuss solutions to common challenges that reoccur throughout bioinformatics including algorithms and heuristics for tackling DNA sequence alignments, phylogenetic reconstructions, evolutionary analysis, and population and human genetics.

What large scale brain networks exist and what are their principles of function? How is information flexibly routed from one area to another? What is the function of thalamocortical loops? We will examine large scale networks revealed by anatomical tracing, functional connectivity studies, and mRNA expression analyses, and explore the brain circuits mediating complex behaviors such as attention, memory, sleep, multisensory integration, decision making, and object vision. While each of these topics could cover an entire course in itself, our focus will be on understanding the master plan--how the components of each of these systems are put together and function as a whole. A key question we will delve into, from both a biological and a theoretical perspective, is: how is information flexibly routed from one brain area to another? We will discuss the communication through coherence hypothesis, small world networks, and sparse coding. Instructor: Tsao.

Prerequisites: Students are recommended (but not required) to take BEM 103 to become familiar with some basic concepts in finance. </em>Much of modern financial economics works with models in which agents are fully rational, in that they maximize expected utility and use Bayes law to update their beliefs. Behavioral finance is a large and active field that develops and studies models in which some agents are less than fully rational. Such models have two building blocks: limits to arbitrage, which makes it difficult for rational traders to undo the dislocations caused by less rational traders; and psychology, which provides guidance for the kinds of deviations from full rationality we might expect to see. We discuss these two topics and consider a number of applications: asset pricing; individual trading behavior; the origin of bubbles; and financial crises. Instructor: Jin.</p><p><strong>BEM/Ec 150.

Introduction to Medieval British Literature. </strong><em>9 units (3-0-6); first term. </em>This course offers a tour of major (as well as some minor) genres and works written in Britain prior to 1500. Far from a literary &ldquo;dark age,&rdquo; the Middle Ages fostered dramatic experiments in narrative form, bequeathing to modern literature some of its best-loved genres and texts. We will practice reading in Middle English-the language of Chaucer and his contemporaries-while we concentrate on the following questions: how did these texts circulate among readers? How do they establish their authority? What kinds of historical and cultural currents to they engage? Texts may include the lives of saints, the confessions of sinners, drama, lyrics, romances, selections from Chaucers Canterbury Tales, and Malorys Morte Darthur. Readings will be in Middle and modern English. Not offered 2016&ndash;17.</p><p><strong>En 104. Imagining the Medieval in the Nineteenth Century. </strong><em>9 units (3-0-6); third term. </em>Following the Enlightenment and amidst the Industrial Revolution, the late-eighteenth and nineteenth centuries saw a surging interest in the literature, lives, art, and architecture of the Middle Ages. In this course, we will explore how authors represented, invoked, and often idealized the medieval past-with its knights, peasants, saints, and monsters-as a way to think through the challenges-social, literary, political, aesthetic-of their own time. We will read several novels, poems, and treatises, including Henry David Thoreaus essay, &ldquo;Walking;&rdquo; Mark Twains <span class="italic">A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthurs Court; </span>Alfred Lord Tennysons <span class="italic">Idylls of the King; </span>and others. Requirements for the course will include weekly response papers and two essays. Not offered 2016&ndash;17.</p><p><strong>En 105. Old English Literature. </strong><em>9 units (3-0-6); first term. </em>&ldquo;Mo&eth;&eth;e word fr&aelig;t.&rdquo; Want to learn how to read the riddle that begins with these words? This course will introduce students to Old English: the earliest form of the English language, spoken in England from roughly the years 450 to 1100. In studying the language, we will turn to its diverse and exciting body of literature, including one poem commemorating the brutal defeat by a Viking army and another based on the biblical story of Judith, who tricks the evil king Holofernes into sleeping with her-but not before slicing off his drunken head. We will also read a variety of shorter texts: laws, medical recipes, humorously obscene riddles. Successful completion of the course will give students a richer sense not only of the earliest period of English literature, but also of the English language as it is written and spoken today. No prior experience with Old or Middle English is necessary for this course. Not offered 2016&ndash;17.</p><p><strong>En 106. Literature and Law in Medieval England. </strong><em>9 units (3-0-6); first term. </em>This course examines one of the most exciting and transformative periods in legal and literary history, the later Middle Ages. In England, this era witnessed the rise of lawyers, the advent of trial by jury, and the amassment of the common law. It saw kings fall, peasants revolt, and religious dissenters condemned for heresy. But it also saw the development of a sophisticated legal system and, alongside it, a burgeoning literary tradition. This class examines that literary tradition while also tracing some key legal developments of the period. We will read poetic texts together with relevant legal materials, including law codes, trial transcripts, and statutes. As we gain a basic introduction to medieval legal topics, we will also consider how poets represent and appropriate law, analyzing, for instance, how the figure of the witness informs genres like romance and hagiography. Certain readings will be in Middle English, but no previous experience with the language is required. Not offered 2016&ndash;17.</p><p><strong>En 107. Medieval Romance. </strong><em>9 units (3-0-6); third term. </em>The medieval term romanz designated both a language, French, and a genre, romance, dedicated to the adventures of knights and ladies and the villains, monsters, magic, and miles that stood in their way. This course explores key examples from the twelfth through the fifteenth centuries, while also examining evolutions in the form. We will consider how romances figured love and desire as well as negotiated questions of law, territory, and cultural difference. Authors and texts may include Chretien de Troyes, Marie de France, Gawain and the Green Knight, Arthurian legends, outlaw tales, and hagiography. Instructor: Jahner.</p><p><strong>En 108. Witnessing Evil in Early Medieval Literature. </strong><em>9 units (3-0-6); first term. </em>Traveling to hell and back, watching the torture of a saint, looking at illustrations of sins: these are profoundly terrible experiences that shaped the way medieval readers took in the world around them. What is at stake when literature allows readers to witness such horrors? While exploring this question, this course will examine the didactic, religious, and epistemological functions of observation and awe in a variety of early medieval texts (in translation), such as Prudentiuss Psychomachia, the Apocalypse of Paul, Anglo-Saxon laws, the Life of St. Margaret, the Old English Genesis, the heroic poem Judith, and Bonifaces riddles about the vices. Instructor: Saltzman.</p><p><strong>En 110. Sinners, Saints, and Sexuality in Premodern Literature. </strong><em>9 units (3-0-6); second term. </em>What made the difference between saint and sinner in medieval and Renaissance literature? This class takes up this question by focusing on the unruly problems of embodiment. We will read across a wide range of literatures, including early medical texts, saints lives, poetry and romance, as we examine how earlier periods understood gender and sexual difference. Questions we may consider include the following: how did writers construct the &ldquo;naturalness&rdquo; or &ldquo;unnaturalness&rdquo; of particular bodies and bodily acts? How did individuals assert control over their own bodies and those of others? In what ways did writing authorize, scrutinize, or police the boundaries of the licit and illicit? Finally, how have modern critics framed these questions? Possible readings include Aristotle, Freud, Chaucer, Margery Kempe, Christine de Pizan, Sidney, Shakespeare. Instructor: Jahner.</p><p><strong>En 113 ab. Shakespeares Career. </strong><em>9 units (3-0-6); first term. </em>A survey of Shakespeares career as a dramatist. The first term will study his comedies and histories; the second, his tragedies and tragicomedies. Students will need to read one play per week. Instructor: Pigman.</p><p><strong>En 118. Classical Mythology. </strong><em>9 units (3-0-6); third term. </em>Why did the Greeks and Romans remain fascinated with the same stories of gods and demigods for more than a thousand years? On the other hand, how did they adapt those stories to fit new times and places? Starting with the earliest Greek poems and advancing through classical Athens, Hellenistic Alexandria, and Augustan Rome, we consider the history of writing poetry as a history of reading the past; the course also serves as an excellent introduction to ancient literary history at large. Readings may include Homers "Odyssey," Hesiod, Aeschylus, Euripides, Apollonius Rhodius, Ovid, and Seneca. Not offered 2016&ndash;17.</p><p><strong>En 119. Displacement. </strong><em>9 units (3-0-6); first term. </em>The literary fascination with people who change places, temporarily or permanently, over a short distance or across the globe, in works dating from our lifetimes and from the recent and the remote past. How readily can such stories be compared, how easy is it to apply traditional categories of literary evaluation, and, in the contemporary world, how have poetry and prose fictions about migration survived alongside other media? 21st-century works will receive considerable attention; other readings may include Virgil, Swift, Flaubert, Mann, Achebe, Nabokov, Didion, Morrison. Instructor: Haugen.</p><p><strong>En 121. Literature and Its Readers. </strong><em>9 units (3-0-6); first term. </em>The course will investigate readers who have made adventurous uses of their favorite works of literature, from Greek antiquity through the 20th century. Sometimes those readers count, at least temporarily, as literary critics, as when the philosopher Aristotle made Sophocles <span class="italic">Oedipus the King </span>the central model in his wildly successful essay on the literary form of tragedy. Other readers have been even more experimental, as when Sigmund Freud, studying the same play, made the &ldquo;Oedipus complex&rdquo; a meeting point for his theory of psychology, his vision of human societies, and his fascination with literary narrative. It will discuss some basic questions about the phenomenon of literary reading. Does a book have a single meaning? Can it be used rightly or wrongly? Not offered 2016&ndash;17.</p><p><strong>En 122. Early History of the Novel. </strong><em>9 units (3-0-6); third term. </em>The realistic novel is a surprising, even experimental moment in the history of fiction. How and why did daily life become a legitimate topic for narrative in the 18th century? The realistic turn clearly attracted new classes of readers, but did it also make the novel a better vehicle for commenting on society at large? Why were the formal conventions of realistic writing so tightly circumscribed? Authors may include Cervantes, Defoe, Richardson, Fielding, Sterne, Walpole, Boswell, and Austen. Instructor: Haugen.</p><p><strong>En 123. The 19th-Century English Novel. </strong><em>9 units (3-0-6); first term. </em>A survey of the 19th-century novel from Austen through Conrad, with special emphasis upon the Victorians.

Particular attention will be paid to intellectual and historical contexts and to new understandings of the role of literature in society. Not offered 2016&ndash;17.</p><p><strong>En 126. Gothic Fiction. </strong><em>9 units (3-0-6); second term. </em>The literature of horror, fantasy, and the supernatural, from the late 18th century to the present day. Particular attention will be paid to gothics shifting cultural imperative, from its origins as a qualified reaction to Enlightenment rationalism, to the contemporary ghost story as an instrument of social and psychological exploration. Issues will include atmosphere and the gothic sense of space; gothic as a popular pathology; and the gendering of gothic narrative. Fiction by Walpole, Shelley, Bront&euml;, Stoker, Poe, Wilde, Angela Carter, and Toni Morrison. Film versions of the gothic may be included. Instructor: Gilmartin.</p><p><strong>En 127. Jane Austen. </strong><em>9 units (3-0-6); third term. </em>This course will focus on the major novels of Jane Austen: <span class="italic">Northanger Abbey, Sense and Sensibility, Pride and Prejudice, Mansfield Park, Emma, </span>and <span class="italic">Persuasion. </span>Film and television adaptations will also be considered, and students may have the opportunity to read Austens unfinished works, as well as related eighteenth- and nineteenth-century British fiction and non-fiction.

Works by Joyce, Yeats, Synge, Friel, OBrien, Heaney, Boland, and others. Not offered 2016&ndash;17.</p><p><strong>En 129. Enlightenment Fiction. </strong><em>9 units (3-0-6); second term. </em>What was the fate of fiction in an Age of Reason? Historians have questioned whether a conventional sense of the Enlightenment adequately accounts for European culture in the 18th century, and the literary imagination can seem particularly unsuited to generalizations about progress, optimism, reason, and social order. This course will consider experimental narratives and philosophical satires from the English and Continental tradition, as well as early Romantic responses to the Enlightenment. Readings may include Defoe, Sterne, Voltaire, Diderot, Mary Shelley, Hoffman, and fairy tales from the brothers Grimm. Not offered 2016&ndash;17.</p><p><strong>En 131. Poes Afterlife. </strong><em>9 units (3-0-6); second term. </em>This course focuses on Edgar Allan Poe and the considerable influence his works have had on other writers. Authors as diverse as Charles Baudelaire, Jules Verne, Jorge Luis Borges, Vladimir Nabokov, John Barth, and Philip Roth have used Poes stories as departure points for their own work. We shall begin by reading some of Poes s classic short stories, including &ldquo;The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Purloined Letter,&rdquo; and others. We shall then explore how and why Poes stories have been so important for authors, despite the fact that his reputation as a great American writer, unlike Hawthornes and Melvilles, for example, is a relatively recent phenomenon. Not offered 2016&ndash;17.</p><p><strong>En 133. 19th-Century American Women Writers. </strong><em>9 units (3-0-6), second term. </em>This course will analyze many of the most popular novels written in the 19th century. How might we account for their success in the 19th century and their marginalization (until recently) in the 20th century? Why were so many of these texts &ldquo;sentimental?&rdquo; How might we understand the appeal of &ldquo;sentimental&rdquo; literature? What are the ideological implications of sentimentalism? Authors may include Stowe, Warner, Cummins, Alcott, Phelps, Fern, etc. Not offered 2016&ndash;17.</p><p><strong>En 134. The Career of Herman Melville. </strong><em>9 units (3-0-6), second term. </em>The course will focus on Melvilles works from <span class="italic">Typee </span>through <span class="italic">Billy Budd. </span>Special emphasis will be placed on Melvilles relations to 19th-century American culture. Not offered 2016&ndash;17.</p><p><strong>En 135. Dickens London. </strong><em>9 units (3-0-6); third term. </em>Charles Dickens and London have perhaps the most famous relationship of any writer and city in English. In this course, we will investigate both the London Dickens knew, and the portrait of the city that he painted, by reading some of Dickenss great mid-career novels alongside a selection of primary and secondary historical sources. We will think about the gap-or overlap- between history and fiction, the idea of the novelist as alternative historian, and the idea of the novel as historical document. Historical topics covered may include: the development of the Victorian police force; plague and public health; Victorian poverty; colonialism and imperialism; Dickens and his illustrators; Victorian exhibition culture; and marriage and the cult of domesticity, among others. In addition to written work, students should expect to be responsible for making a short research presentation at some point in the term. Instructor: Gilmore.</p><p><strong>En 136. The Fiction of Charles Dickens. </strong><em>9 units (3-0-6). </em>An overview of the Great Inimitables fiction, concentrating on four texts representative of different phases of his novel-writing career and their relationship to the changing world of Victorian Britain: <span class="italic">Oliver Twist, Dombey and Son, Bleak House, Our Mutual Friend. </span>Not offered 2016&ndash;17.</p><p><strong>En 137. African American Literature. </strong><em>9 units (3-0-6); second term. </em>This course analyzes some of the great works of American literature written by African Americans. This body of writing gives rise to two crucial questions: How does African American literature constitute a literary tradition of its own? How is that tradition inextricable from American literary history? From slave narratives to Toni Morrisons <span class="italic">Beloved, </span>from the Harlem Renaissance to Alice Walker, from Ralph Ellison to Walter Mosley, African American literature has examined topics as diverse and important as race relations, class identification, and family life. We shall analyze these texts not only in relation to these cultural issues, but also in terms of their aesthetic and formal contributions. Not offered 2016&ndash;17.</p><p><strong>En 138. Twain and His Contemporaries. </strong><em>9 units (3-0-6); third term. </em>This course will study the divergent theories of realism that arose in the period after the Civil War and before World War I.

American Ethnic Literature. </strong><em>9 units (3-0-6); second term. </em>From the idea of the melting pot to contemporary debates about multiculturalism, the costs and benefits of assimilation have been crucial to understanding what it means to be American in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. We will be reading novels, autobiographies, sociology, and other texts that describe the struggles of newcomers to adapt to an alien culture while also, often, trying to negotiate a meaningful relation to their native culture. Authors covered may include Anzia Yezierska, Maxine Hong Kingston, Frank Chin, Richard Rodriguez, Philip Roth, and T. C. Boyle. Not offered 2016&ndash;17.</p><p><strong>En/F 160 ab. Classical Hollywood Cinema. </strong><em>9 units (3-0-6); first term. </em>This course introduces students to Hollywood films and filmmaking during the classical period, from the coming of sound through the &lsquo;50s. Students will develop the techniques and vocabulary appropriate to the distinct formal properties of film. Topics include the rise and collapse of the studio system, technical transformations (sound, color, deep focus), genre (the musical, the melodrama), cultural contexts (the Depression, World War II, the Cold War), audience responses, and the economic history of the film corporations. Terms may be taken independently. Part a covers the period 1927-1940. Part b covers 1941-1960. Instructor: Jurca.</p><p><strong>En/F 161. The New Hollywood. </strong><em>9 units (3-0-6). </em>This course examines the post-classical era of Hollywood filmmaking with a focus on the late 1960s through the 1970s, a period of significant formal and thematic experimentation especially in the representation of violence and sexuality.

We will pay particular attention to the changing film industry and its influence on this body of work. Films covered may include Bonnie and Clyde, The Wild Bunch, The Last Picture Show, Jaws, and Taxi Driver. Not offered 2016&ndash;17.</p><p><strong>En 178. Medieval Subjectivities. </strong><em>9 units (3-0-6); second term. </em>In the seventeenth century, Descartes penned his famous expression &ldquo;I think therefore I am!&rdquo; and thus the modern subject was born-or so the simplified story goes. But long before the age of Descartes, the Middle Ages produced an astonishing range of theories and ideas about human selfhood, subjectivity, and interiority. For instance, writing from prison more than one thousand years earlier, Boethius came to realize that what distinguishes a human being from all other creatures is his capacity to &ldquo;know himself.&rdquo; The meaning of this opaque statement and others like it will command our attention throughout this course, as we explore the diverse, distinctive, and often highly sophisticated notions of subjectivity that developed in the literatures of the Middle Ages. We will take up questions of human agency, free will, identity, self-consciousness, confession, and secrecy as we encounter them in some of the most exciting texts written during the period, including among others) Augustines <span class="italic">Confessions, </span>Prudentiuss <span class="italic">Psychomachia, </span>the Old English poem "The Wanderer," the mystical writings of Margery Kempe and Julian of Norwich, and Chaucers <span class="italic">Troilus and Criseyde. </span>Not offered 2016&ndash;17.</p><p><strong>En 179. Constituting Citizenship before the Fourteenth Amendment. </strong><em>9 units (3-0-6); second term. </em>What can a slaves narrative teach us about citizenship? How did the new nation identify citizens when its Constitution seemed so silent on the matter? And how did one tailors pamphlet result in one of most massive restrictions of free speech in U.S. history? Our goal over the semester will be to sketch a story of African American literary production from the latter half of the eighteenth century to the Civil War and to tease out, through this literature, developing understandings of citizenship in the United States. We will read letters, poems, sermons, songs, constitutions and bylaws, short stories, and texts that simply defy easy categorization. We will also spend several sessions becoming familiar with key newspapers and magazines-Freedoms Journal, Frederick Douglasss Paper, The Anglo-African Magazine, Christian Recorder, and The Crisis-to deepen our understanding of the kinds of things people were reading and writing on a regular basis and the kinds of arguments they were making. Writers up for discussion may include: Frederick Douglass, James Madison, Harriet Jacobs, Henry David Thoreau, Sojourner Truth, and David Walker. Not offered 2016&ndash;17.</p><p><strong>En 180. Special Topics in English. </strong><em>9 units (3-0-6). See registrars announcement for details. </em>Instructor: Staff.</p><p><strong>En 181. Hardy: The Wessex Novels. </strong><em>9 units (3-0-6); third term. </em>This course will examine the body of work that the late Victorian novelist Thomas Hardy published under the general title "The Wessex Novels," that is, the sequence of works from <span class="italic">Far from the Madding Crowd </span>to <span class="italic">Jude the Obscure. </span>The six main novels will be read critically to give a sense of the totality of this greatest British regional novelists achievement. Not offered 2016&ndash;17.</p><p><strong>En 182. Literature and the First Amendment. </strong><em>9 units (3-0-6); third term. </em>&ldquo;Freedom of speech,&rdquo; writes Benjamin Cardozo in <span class="italic">Palko v. Connecticut (1937), </span>&ldquo;is the matrix, the indispensable condition, of nearly every other form of freedom.&rdquo; We will go inside the matrix, focusing on how it has affected the books we read. This is not a course in constitutional law or political philosophy, but an opportunity to examine how American literary culture has intersected with law and politics. We will investigate the ways in which the meanings of &ldquo;freedom,&rdquo; what it entails, and who is entitled to it have changed over time. Possible topics include the obscenity trials surrounding Allen Ginsbergs <span class="italic">Howl </span>and James Joyces <span class="italic">Ulysses, </span>crackdowns on anti-war propagandists, and the legal battle between <span class="italic">Hustler </span>publisher Larry Flynt and televangelist and Moral Majority cofounder Jerry Falwell. Instructor: Hunter.</p><p><strong>En 183. Victorian Crime Fiction. </strong><em>9 units (3-0-6); first term. </em>In 19th-century Britain, for the first time in human history, more of a nations citizens came to live in urban areas than in rural ones. This result of the Industrial Revolution produced many effects, but in the fiction of the period, one of the most striking was an obsession with the problem of crime. Victorian authors filled their novels with murder, prisons, poisonings, prostitution, criminals, and the new figure of the detective; in this class we will look at the social history, publishing developments, and formal dilemmas that underlay such a response. Authors studied may include Dickens, Collins, Braddon, Conan Doyle, Chesterton, and Conrad, among others. Not offered 2016&ndash;17.</p><p><strong>En 185. Dickens and the Dickensian. </strong><em>9 units (3-0-6). </em>The adjective &ldquo;Dickensian&rdquo; makes an almost daily appearance in todays newspapers, magazines, and other media sources. It is used to describe everything from outrageous political scandals, to Bollywood musicals, to multiplot novels. But what does the word really mean? And what part of Charles Dickenss output does it refer to? This class will consider some of Dickenss most famous works alongside a series of contemporary novels, all critically described in &ldquo;Dickensian&rdquo; terms. The main concern will be equally with style and form, and 19th-century and present-day circumstances of production (e.g., serialization, mass production, Web publication, etc.). Authors considered (aside from Dickens) may include Richard Price, Zadie Smith, Monica Ali, and Jonathan Franzen. Not offered 2016&ndash;17.</p><p><strong>En 186. The Novel of Education. </strong><em>9 units (3-0-6); third term. </em>What does it mean to be educated? This class will consider this question via a series of novels that take us from secondary school to the university, and from the nineteenth century to the present. Concentrating on British literature, with its compelling tendency to focalize historical anxieties about class, race and social reform through depictions of formal schooling practices, we too will consider these issues as we enter classrooms and eavesdrop on faculty conversations. At the same time, there will be ample scope to engage with more abstract questions about power, pedagogy, and alienation, and we will use our readings rich stock of schoolyard bullies, boarding school mean girls, struggling scholars and power-mad professors as the concrete anchor for such considerations. Authors read may include Dickens, Bronte, Waugh, Amis, Spark, Lodge, Ishiguro and Zadie Smith. Not offered 2016&ndash;17.</p><p><strong>En 190. Chaucer. </strong><em>9 units (3-0-6); second term. </em>This course devotes itself to the writings of the diplomat, courtier, bureaucrat, and poet, Geoffrey Chaucer. Best known for the Canterbury Tales, Chaucer also authored dream visions, lyrics, and philosophical meditations. This course will introduce you to some better-known and lesser-known works in the Chaucerian corpus, while also exploring questions central to the production and circulation of literature in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries. What did it mean to &ldquo;invent&rdquo; a literary work in late medieval England? How did Chaucer imagine himself as a writer and reader? What are the hallmarks of Chaucerian style, and how did Chaucer become the canonical author he is today? We will read Chaucers works in their original language, Middle English, working slowly enough to give participants time to familiarize themselves with syntax and spelling. No previous experience with the language is necessary. Not offered 2016&ndash;17.</p><p><strong>En 191. Masterworks of Contemporary Latin American Fiction. </strong><em>9 units (3-0-6); third term. </em>This course studies Latin Americas most influential authors in the 20th and 21st centuries, with a focus on short stories and novellas produced by the regions avant-garde and &ldquo;boom&rdquo; generations.

Not offered 2016&ndash;17.</p><p><strong>En/H 193. Cervantes, Truth or Dare: Don Quixote in an Age of Empire. </strong><em>9 units (3-0-6); third term. </em>Studies Cervantess literary masterpiece, Don Quixote, with a view to the great upheavals that shaped the early modern world: Renaissance Europes discovery of America; feudalisms demise and the rise of mass poverty; Reformation and Counter-Reformation; extermination of heretics and war against infidels; and the decline of the Hapsburg dynasty. The hapless protagonist of Don Quixote calls into question the boundaries between sanity and madness, truth and falsehood, history and fiction, objectivity and individual experience. What might be modern, perhaps even revolutionary, in Cervantess dramatization of the moral and material dilemmas of his time? Conducted in English. Instructor: Wey-Gomez.</p><p><strong>En/H 197. American Literature and the Technologies of Reading. </strong><em>9 units (3-0-6); second term. </em>This course explores the material forms of American literature from the colonial era through the nineteenth century. We will study how and by whom books and other kinds of texts were produced, and how these forms shaped and were shaped by readers engagement with them. Possible topics include the history of such printing technologies as presses, types, paper, ink, binding, and illustration; the business of bookmaking and the development of the publishing industry; the rise of literary authorship; the career of Benjamin Franklin; print, politics, and the American Revolution; and manuscript culture.

Whether writing a thesis or term paper, undertaking an oral exam, or presenting at a conference or seminar, the organization of ideas is central, of course, but the details of formatting, grammar, logic, word choice and delivery are a close second. This course includes frequent in-class oral presentations by students based on their current research interests, followed by detailed critiques of pronunciation and style and ample opportunity for practice to develop both English confidence and delivery skills. The writing portion of the course includes classroom exercises and editing practice will be based on student writing samples. Here, also, the emphasis will be on content, logic, formatting and grammar, work choices, as well as punctuation. The goals of the course include improvement of confidence and presentation skills, and the ability to communicate clearly and concisely in both oral and written English. Enrollment is limited, with priority given to graduate students.

Freshman Seminar: The Origins of Ideas. </strong><em>6 units (2-0-4); second term. </em>Why do we have 60 minutes in an hour? Why do we use a fork or chopsticks when we eat? Why do we have music? Why do we have sports? The goal of the class is to learn how to enjoy ignorance, be curious and try and discover the origin and the evolutionary processes that led to the ideas and artifacts that are a part of our life. The class is collaborative and interactive: You will teach as much as you will learn - you will learn as much as you will teach. Most importantly, you will realize the fun in discovery and the joy of human interaction. Freshmen only; limited enrollment. Not offered 2016&ndash;17.</p><p><strong>FS/Ay 3. Freshman Seminar: Automating Discovering the Universe. </strong><em>6 units (2-0-4); second term. </em>Powerful new instruments enable astronomers to collect huge volumes of data on billions of objects. As a result, astronomy is changing dramatically: by the end of this decade, most astronomers will probably be analysing data collected in large surveys, and only a few will still be visiting observatories to collect their own data. The tool chest of future astronomers will involve facility with &ldquo;big data&rdquo;, developing clever queries, algorithms (some based on machine learning) and statistics, and combining multiple databases. This course will introduce students to some of these tools. After &ldquo;recovering&rdquo; known objects, students will be unleashed to make their own astronomical discoveries in new data sets. Limited enrollment. Instructors: Kulkarni.</p><p><strong>FS/Ph 4. Freshman Seminar: Astrophysics and Cosmology with Open Data. </strong><em>6 units (3-0-3); first term. </em>Astrophysics and cosmology are in the midst of a golden age of science-rich observations from incredibly powerful telescopes of various kinds. The data from these instruments are often freely available on the web. Anyone can do things like study x-rays from pulsars in our galaxy or gamma rays from distant galaxies using data from Swift and Fermi; discover planets eclipsing nearby stars using data from Kepler; measure the expansion of the universe using supernovae data; study the cosmic microwave background with data from Planck; find gravitational waves from binary black hole mergers using data from LIGO; and study the clustering of galaxies using Hubble data. We will explore some of these data sets and the science than can be extracted from them. A primary goal of this class is to develop skills in scientific computing and visualization - bring your laptop! Not offered 2016&ndash;17.</p><p><strong>FS/Ph 9. Freshman Seminar: The Science of Music. </strong><em>6 units (2-0-4); first term. </em>This course will focus on the physics of sound, how musical instruments make it, and how we hear it, including readings, discussions, demonstrations, and student observations using sound analysis software. In parallel we will consider what differentiates music from other sounds, and its role psychically and culturally. Students will do a final project of their choice and design, with possibilities including a book review, analysis of recordings of actual musical instruments, or instrument construction and analysis. <span class="italic">Freshmen only; limited enrollment. Instructor: Politzer.</span></p><p><strong>FS/Ph 11 abc. Freshman Seminar: Research Tutorial. </strong><em>6 units (2-0-4); second, third terms of freshman year and first term of sophomore year. </em>A small number of students will be offered the opportunity to enroll in this tutorial, the purpose of which is to demonstrate how research ideas arise, and are evaluated and tested, and how those ideas that survive are developed. This is accomplished by doing individual, original projects. There will be weekly group meetings and individual tutorial meetings with the instructor. Support for summer research at Caltech between freshman and sophomore years will be automatic for those students making satisfactory progress. Graded pass/fail. <span class="italic">Freshmen only; limited enrollment.</span> Instructor: Phillips.</p><p><strong>FS/Ma 12. Freshman Seminar: The Mathematics of Enzyme Kinetics. </strong><em>6 units (2-0-4); third term. Prerequisites: Ma 1a, b. </em>Enzymes are at the heart of biochemistry. We will begin with a down to earth discussion of how, as catalysts, they are used to convert substrate to product. Then we will model their activity by using explicit equations. Under ideal conditions, their dynamics are described by a system of first order differential equations. The difficulty will be seen to stem from them being non-linear. However, under a steady state hypothesis, they reduce to a simpler equation, whose solution can describe the late time behavior. The students will apply it to some specially chosen, real examples. Not offered 2016&ndash;17.</p><p><strong>FS/Bi 13.

The course focuses on the reading, analysis, and discussion of primary sources. Not offered 2016&ndash;17.</p><p><strong>H 108 b. The High Middle Ages. </strong><em>9 units (3-0-6); third term. </em>This course is designed to introduce students to European history between 1000 and 1400. It will provide a topical as well as chronological examination of the economic, social, political, and religious evolution of western Europe during this period, with a focus on France, Italy, England, and Germany. The course emphasizes the reading, analysis, and discussion of primary sources. Not offered 2016&ndash;17.</p><p><strong>H 109. Medieval Knighthood. </strong><em>9 units (3-0-6); first term. </em>This course tells the story of the knight from his beginnings in the early Middle Ages, through his zenith in the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries, to his decline and transformation in the late medieval and early modern periods. The course treats the knight not simply as a military phenomenon but also as a social, political, religious, and cultural figure who personified many of the elements that set the Middle Ages apart. Instructor: Brown.</p><p><strong>H 111. The Medieval Church. </strong><em>9 units (3-0-6); second term. </em>This course takes students through the history of the medieval Christian Church in Europe, from its roots in Roman Palestine, through the zenith of its power in the high Middle Ages, to its decline on the eve of the Reformation. The course focuses on the church less as a religion (although it will by necessity deal with some basic theology) than as an institution that came to have an enormous political, social, cultural, and economic impact on medieval life, and for a brief time made Rome once more the mistress of Europe. Not offered 2016&ndash;17.</p><p><strong>H 112. The Vikings. </strong><em>9 units (3-0-6); third term. </em>This course will take on the Scandinavian seafaring warriors of the 8th&ndash;11th centuries as a historical problem. What were the Vikings, where did they come from, and how they did they differ from the Scandinavian and north German pirates and raiders who preceded them? Were they really the horned-helmeted, bloodthirsty barbarians depicted by modern popular media and by many medieval chronicles? What effect did they have in their roughly two centuries of raiding and colonization on the civilizations of medieval and ultimately modern Europe? Not offered 2016&ndash;17.</p><p><strong>H 115 abc. British History. </strong><em>9 units (3-0-6); first, second, third terms. </em>The political and cultural development of Great Britain from the early modern period to the twentieth century.

We will cover slave conspiracies, witch trials, religious struggles, impressment riots, Native uprisings, imperial wars, American independence, agrarian protest, and various manifestations of political opposition, organization, and violence. We will also critically interrogate the &ldquo;naming&rdquo; of these various forms of resistance and modes of conflict. Instructor: Gronningsater.</p><p><strong>H 120. American History: The Long Nineteenth Century. </strong><em>9 units (3-0-6); third term. </em>This course examines the history of the &ldquo;long&rdquo; nineteenth century in the United States.

Topics include: the formation and destruction of political party systems, reform movements, religious revivalism and identity, Indian removal, continental expansion, the Civil War and Reconstruction, Jim Crow, labor movements, immigration, and transformations in transportation, communication, and consumption.Instructor: Gronningsater.</p><p><strong>H 121. American Radicalism. </strong><em>9 units (3-0-6); offered by announcement. </em>The course will cover a number of radical social, political, and artistic movements in 20th-century America. A focus on the first two decades of the century will center around the poet, journalist, and revolutionary John Reed and his circle in Greenwich Village. Topics will include their involvement with artistic experimentation, the Industrial Workers of the World, the Mexican Revolution, the Russian Revolution, and the movements for birth control and against American involvement in World War I. Other areas of concentration will be the Great Depression of the 30s, with its leftist political and labor actions, and the freewheeling radicalism of the 60s, including the anti-Vietnam protests, Students for a Democratic Society, and the ethnic struggles for social and political equality. Some reference will be made to the anti-globalization movements of today. Not offered 2016&ndash;17.</p><p><strong>H 122. Household and Family Forms over Time. </strong><em>9 units (3-0-6); first term. </em>This course examines the wide variety of family forms and household structures in past societies, as well as the social, cultural, institutional, and economic variables that influenced them. The course focuses mainly on Europe from about 1600 to the present, as this is the area for which most research has been done, but there will be some discussion of other parts of the world, including Asia, Africa, and North and South America. Special attention is given to comparisons among different societies. Not offered 2016&ndash;17.</p><p><strong>H/SS 124. Problems in Historical Demography. </strong><em>9 units (3-0-6); first term. </em>Birth, marriage, and death&mdash;the most basic events in peoples lives&mdash;are inextricably linked to larger economic and social phenomena. An understanding of these basic events can thus shed light on the economic and social world inhabited by people in the past. In this course students will be introduced to the sources and methods used by historical demographers to construct demographic measures for past populations. In addition, the course will cover a broad range of problems in historical demography, including mortality crises, fertility control, infant mortality, and the role of economic and social institutions in demographic change. While the emphasis is on societies in the past, there will be some discussion of modern demographic trends in various parts of the world. Not offered 2016&ndash;17.</p><p><strong>H 125. Soviet Russia. </strong><em>9 units (3-0-6); first term. </em>Why was the Russian Revolution of 1917 successful? And how did the Soviet system survive nearly 75 years? These questions will be addressed in the wider context of Russian history, with a focus on political, economic, and social institutions in the pre- and post-revolutionary period. Subjects covered include the ideological underpinnings of Bolshevism, Lenin and the Bolshevik coup, the rise of Stalin, collectivization, socialist realism, the command economy, World War II, the Krushchev &lsquo;thaw, dissident culture and the arts, popular culture, and Gorbachevs perestroika. A variety of sources will be used, including secondary historical literature, fiction, film, and art. Not offered 2016&ndash;17.</p><p><strong>H 127. History and the Anthropocene. </strong><em>9 units (3-0-6); second term. </em>In 2000, Nobel Prize-winning chemist Paul Crutzen and his colleague Eugene Stoermer argued that we should adopt a new term-the Anthropocene-to recognize the central place of humanity in shaping the earths geological, chemical, and biological systems. Since then, the term has become increasingly prominent among academic and popular writers. The concept of the Anthropocene, although ostensibly a question of geologic periodization, has implications for many other disciplines, particularly history. This course will explore the development of the concept, the history of ideas about the relationship between people and the natural world, and implications for how we understand and talk about the past. Instructor: Pluymers.</p><p><strong>H 128. Sustainability and Conservation in the Early Modern World. </strong><em>9 units (3-0-6); first term. </em>Sustainability-from corporate boardrooms to communes, the term has been the subject of protests, marketing campaigns, and government policies. Scientists, activists, and politicians have proposed new methods for achieving it; however, the history of the term remains murky. In this course, we will explore how early modern people understood and regulated resources to try to uncover examples of sustainable farming, forestry, and industry from the past. Unlike many courses that focus on specific regions, we will reach beyond borders to examine the intersections of the modes of regulation of resources in Asia, Europe, and North America during the early modern period. Instructors: Pluymers.</p><p><strong>H 129. Rivers and Human History. </strong><em>9 units (3-0-6); second term. </em>For thousands of years, rivers have been central to human history. They have served as crucial sources of food and water, the sites for religious and political ceremonies, and corridors for transportation. Rivers have also flooded, become polluted, and even caught fire. In this course we will explore how human beings around the world have attempted to manage rivers and the people who live alongside them examining topics such as damming, diversion, and flood control. We will conclude by examining the history and future of the Los Angeles River and its tributaries, which, as concretized flood control channels, offer a unique example of the transformative power of engineering. For this section, students will take a field trip to explore the Los Angeles River. Not offered 2016&ndash;17.</p><p><strong>H 130. Innovative History. </strong><em>9 units (3-0-6); second term. </em>In recent years some historians have experimented with new and innovative ways of telling the past-on the printed page, using film and video, and on the Internet. The course will focus on these new approaches to historical presentation and knowledge. Students will read, watch, and interact with various examples of these innovative historical works. They will also be exposed to the critiques of traditional historical writing from philosophers, literary critics, and postmodern theorists, which provide intellectual underpinning for experimenting with new forms of history. Not offered 2016&ndash;17.</p><p><strong>H/F 131. History on Film. </strong><em>9 units (2-2-5); second term. </em>An investigation into the variety of ways history has been and can be represented on the screen. Some terms the focus will be a specific historical period or nation; other terms the focus will be the nature of film as a medium for history and biography. The class will include weekly screenings of films as well as weekly discussion sections. Not offered 2016&ndash;17.</p><p><strong>H/F 132. Nations/Cultures on Film: Japan. </strong><em>9 units (2-2-5); third term. </em>Based upon the premise that a great deal of the history and culture of a nation is inscribed in the dramatic features its film makers produce, the course will each term focus on a single nation and/or culture. Each week there will be a screening, supplemented by appropriate readings dealing with history, culture, and film analysis. During the two hour weekly seminar, students will be expected to discuss the film and the readings, while the instructor will provide additional background material and introduce them to the language of cinema. Possible topics include the United States, Japan, Russia, France, Spain, Germany, and Italy. On occasion the class may deal with particular periods in history (e.g. the Italian Renaissance, Imperial Rome) or with cultures that cross national boundaries, such as the Arab World or Latin America. Students will be expected to write short papers after most screenings and one formal term paper. Not offered 2016&ndash;17.</p><p><strong>H/F 133. Topics in Film History. </strong><em>9 units (2-2-5); offered by announcement. </em>The course will focus each term on one kind of motion picture&mdash;either a film genre, or films made by an individual director, or from a single nation or region of the world or particular historical era. Included are weekly screenings, readings on film, a weekly discussion meeting, and a term paper. Not offered 2016&ndash;17.</p><p><strong>H/F 134. The Science Fiction Film. </strong><em>9 units (2-2-5); third term. </em>This course will introduce students to some of the classic works of the science fiction film from the earliest days of cinema until the present. It will analyze aesthetic, historical, and social documents, and will show that such films, while describing alternative, hypothetical, and futurist worlds, also serve as a commentary upon and/or a critique of contemporary (to the film) historical, social, political, and ideological systems and attitudes. Not offered 2016&ndash;17.</p><p><strong>H 135. War, Conquest, and Empires. </strong><em>9 units (3-0-6); second term. </em>This course will use historical examples of war and conquest and ask why some periods of history were times of warfare and why certain countries developed a comparative advantage in violence. The examples will come from the history of Europe and Asia, from ancient times up until World War I, and the emphasis throughout will be on the interplay between politics, military technology, and social conditions. Instructor: Hoffman.</p><p><strong>H/F 136. Ethnic Visions. </strong><em>9 units (2-2-5); offered by announcement. </em>In recent decades, directors from ethnic minorities that are often un- or misrepresented in mainstream Hollywood films have been making dramatic features depicting the history, problems, and prospects of their own communities. This course will feature a selection of such films by directors from African, Latino, Asian, Muslim, and European American ethnic groups, with an eye toward assessing the similarities and differences in the processes of immigration, acculturation, and Americanization. Not offered 2016&ndash;17.</p><p><strong>H 137. Criminals, Outlaws, and Justice in a Thousand Years of Chinese History. </strong><em>9 units (3-0-6); second term. </em>This course explores the shifting boundary between discourses of crime and disobedience over the last millennium or so of Chinese history. It offers fictional, philosophical, political, propagandistic, official, and personal writings on crime and those who commit it as a basis for a wide-ranging series of discussions about when breaking the law is good, when breaking the law is bad, and who gets to decide where the line between a criminal and an outlaw should be drawn. Instructor: Dykstra.</p><p><strong>H 138. From Sage Kings to the CCP: A Primer on Ruler, State and Empire in the History of Chinese Government. </strong><em>9 units (3-0-6); first term. </em>This course surveys a large sample of writings on the craft of governance from across the span of Chinese history. It offers students a chance to explore new and old perspectives on leadership, organization, discipline, bureaucracy, justice, and other classic themes of statecraft writings. These materials will be placed in the context of several shifts in and disagreements about the methods of governance in Chinese history so that students may reflect on the dynamic tension between theory, belief, intention, and action in dictating the way that individuals describe the state. Instructor: Dykstra.</p><p><strong>H/L 142. Perspectives on History through Russian Literature. </strong><em>9 units (3-0-6), second term. </em>The Russian intelligentsia registered the arrival of modern urban society with a highly articulate sensitivity, perhaps because these changes&mdash;industrialization, the breakdown of traditional hierarchies and social bonds, the questioning of traditional beliefs&mdash;came to Russia so suddenly. This gives their writings a paradigmatic quality; the modern dilemmas that still haunt us are made so eloquently explicit in them that they have served as models for succeeding generations of writers and social critics. This course explores these writings (in English translation) against the background of Russian society, focusing especially on particular works of Chekhov, Dostoevsky, Goncharov, Tolstoy, and Turgenev. Not offered 2016&ndash;17.</p><p><strong>Law/PS/H 148 ab. The Supreme Court in U.S. History. </strong><em>9 units (3-0-6). </em>For course description, see Law.</p><p><strong>HPS/H 152.

The Constitution in the Early Republic. </strong><em>9 units (3-0-6); first term. </em>This course will trace many of the major constitutional debates that occurred during the first half-century of U.S. History. We will look to the courts, to the legislatures, to Presidents, and to constitutional theorists of the Early Republic to gain insight into how the first generations of Americans understood their Constitution and the governments and rights it recognized. During this formative period, Americans contemplate the location of sovereignty in a federated republic, the rights and privileges of citizenship, and the role of judicial review in a democratic society. Though we will remain firmly entrenched in the period before the Civil War, we will find that many of the issues that created constitutional strife two centuries ago are still relevant to the constitutional questions of today. Not offered 2016&ndash;17.</p><p><strong>H 188. Origins of the US Civil War. </strong><em>9 units (3-0-6); first term. </em>The purpose of this course is to investigate the various causes of the US Civil War. Students will be exposed to prevailing interpretations, which rely mostly on national frames of reference when identifying the economic, political, and constitutional causes of the Sectional Crisis and War. Half of the term will be devoted to these themes. Subsequently, we will be spending the second half of the term examining recent scholarship that examines the international factors on the brewing Sectional Crisis, from the ramifications of British Emancipation to the fluctuating global cotton market. During the last week, we will discuss these interpretative differences and identify possible avenues of synthesis. Students will leave the course with a thorough understanding of the causes of the Civil War and an introduction to transnational influences on American historical development. Not offered 2016&ndash;17.</p><p><strong>H 189. The Ethics of War. </strong><em>9 units (3-0-6); third term. </em>We tend to think of violence as a breakdown in social order, but warfare, as an organized form of violence, complicates this perspective. Can waging war and upholding justice go hand in hand? In this seminar, we will explore theories of just war from Classical antiquity through the Middle Ages, paying particular attention to methods of categorizing warfare, women at war, and pacifist critiques. The course will conclude by assessing depictions of medieval warfare in contemporary culture, such as Vikings or Game of Thrones. Readings may include Aristotle, Cicero, Augustine, Thomas Aquinas, medieval handbooks of chivalry, &AElig;lfric of Eynsham, documents from the trial of Joan of Arc, and Thomas More. Instructor: Klement.</p><p><strong>H/L 191. Perspectives on History through German Literature. </strong><em>9 units (3-0-6); second term. </em>Industrialization, economic growth, and democracy came to Germany much later than to England and France, and the forms they took in Germany were filtered through the specific institutional character of Central Europe. German-speaking writers and intellectuals saw these trends from the perspective of indigenous intellectual traditions, and the resulting collisions of values and priorities largely shaped European and American social, political, and literary debates for much of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. This course explores these writings (in English translation) against the historical background of Central European society, focusing on particular works of Goethe, Hoffmann, Heine, Nietzsche, Kafka, Rilke, and Mann. Not offered 2016&ndash;17.</p><p><strong>H 192. The Crusades. </strong><em>9 units (3-0-6); third term. </em>This course will introduce students to the series of religiously motivated European invasions of the Middle and Near East that began at the end of the eleventh century and that led to the creation of Latin Christian principalities in Palestine. Though the crusading movement came to embroil much of Europe itself, the course will focus strictly on the military expeditions to what the Crusaders called the Holy Land, and the history of the Crusader states up to the point of their destruction at the end of the thirteenth century. The course will be guided by the following questions: how did medieval Christianity justify wars of aggression against foreign peoples and religions? What motivated western Europeans to leave their homes and march into a hostile environment, where they often faced impoverishment if not death and where maintaining a Christian presence was a constant struggle? How did they manage to erect stable political entities in alien territory that lasted as long as they did, and how did they have to adapt their own culture to do so? Finally, how did the native peoples of the regions the Crusaders invaded and conquered&mdash;Muslim but also Christian and Jewish &mdash; perceive the Crusaders? How did the Crusaders presence affect life in a region whose populations had their own ancient histories and patterns of life? Instructor: Brown.</p><p><strong>En/H 193.

Students will be introduced to these issues through selections from some of the worlds greatest philosophical works, including Descartess <span class="italic">Meditations</span>, Pascals <span class="italic">Pens&eacute;es</span>, Humes <span class="italic">Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding</span>, Berkeleys <span class="italic">Principles of Human Knowledge</span>, and Kants <span class="italic">Prolegomena to any Future Metaphysics</span>. A variety of more contemporary readings will also be assigned. Instructors: Hitchcock, Eberhardt.</p><p><strong>Hum/Pl 42. Philosophy and Gender. </strong><em>9 units (3-0-6); offered by announcement. </em>This course discusses the metaphysics of gender and explores some of its social and political dimensions. The main intellectual approach is that of analytic philosophy, but source materials from other philosophical traditions and intellectual disciplines will be examined. The first part of the course examines various philosophical answers to the question: What makes someone a woman or a man (or both or neither)? The second part illustrates why the metaphysics matters: views about the nature of gender not only affect individuals own senses of identity, but also have ramifications for politics, anthropology, history, psychology, and the arts. Instructor: Cowie.</p><p><strong>Hum/Pl 43. Environmental Ethics. </strong><em>9 units (3-0-6); offered by announcement. </em>Should we clone mammoths back to life? Is it wrong to cause an extinction, and if so, why? Are some species more valuable than others? In this course, students will become familiar with basic topics in meta-ethics and normative ethics through focus on the subject matter of environmental ethics. An overarching question is the relationship between environmental ethics and traditional philosophical ethics: is there an easy fit, or does environmental ethics represent an extension or challenge to traditional ethics? Subject matter may include the biodiversity crisis, climate change, anthropocentrism and its critics, intrinsic value arguments, deep ecology, animal rights, and rewilding. Instructor: Quinn.</p><p><strong>Hum/F 50. Introduction to Film Studies. </strong><em>9 units (3-0-6); offered by announcement. </em>This course examines film as a technology, entertainment medium, and commercial art with an emphasis on American and European contexts.

Introduction to Political Science. </strong><em>9 units (3-0-6); first, third terms. </em>Introduction to the tools and concepts of analytical political science. Subject matter is primarily American political processes and institutions. Topics: spatial models of voting, redistributive voting, games, presidential campaign strategy, Congress, congressional-bureaucratic relations, and coverage of political issues by the mass media. Instructors: Ordeshook, Kiewiet.</p><p><strong>PS 20. Political-Economic Development and Material Culture. </strong><em>9 units (3-0-6); second term. </em>During the 19th-century the American economy, despite the Civil War, caught up to and surpassed all European economies. How did the likes of Singer, John Deere and Seth Thomas -- latecomers to the markets they served - come to dominate those markets both domestically and internationally? Why did the technology of interchangeable parts and mass production become known as &lsquo;the American system when much of that technology was imported from Europe? What role did government play in facilitating or thwarting innovation and economic growth? This course will explore such questions as reflected in the ordinary things people collect under the label &lsquo;antiques.
